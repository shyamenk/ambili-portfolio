                  Ambili was born and raised in Chentrappinni, a coastal village
                  in the Thrissur district of Kerala, South India. The natural
                  beauty of the riverside, the grandeur of the Arabian Sea, and
                  the colorful hide-and-seek of the setting sun captivated him
                  during his younger days, drawing him into the enchanting world
                  of colors and paints. From an early age, he knew he wanted to
                  be a painterâ€”and he fulfilled that ambition.{" "}
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  He earned a national diploma in fine arts from a prestigious
                  institution in Asia. His deep knowledge and understanding of
                  color combinations and painting techniques not only made him a
                  great painter but also paved the way for his success as a
                  photographer, art director, and eventually a filmmaker. He
                  began his journey in the world of art through hoardings and
                  cinema slides and quickly gained recognition.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Over his career, Ambili served as the art director for about
                  150 South Indian films. His creativity was evident in the
                  posters and titles he brought to life through his art. With
                  his vast experience as an art director and a keen
                  understanding of frames and editing, he transitioned into
                  filmmaking. His debut film, Veenapoovu, was released in 1981.

                  Now fully devoted to painting, Ambili is planning solo
                  exhibitions on national and international platforms,
                  continuing to captivate audiences with his artistic vision.
